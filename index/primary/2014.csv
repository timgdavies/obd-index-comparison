Looking at rail where there is an interstate system, similar to the UK, Australia has a nationally supported rail system in which the actual service is provided by private operators (but track is publicly owned and maintained). Similar to the UK, there are therefore good public interest grounds for the government to require provision of timetable data. Focusing on rail then there is no consolidated database of timetable information - instead you are directed off to each rail companies website where you must do your own lookup using a classic HTML interface.

Although the expenditure information is published quarterly, the ""plans"" are not currently published in OSCAR data until the end of the financial year to which they relate. Once Plans information is available on OSCAR it is available for bulk download in machine readable format (CSV). In assessing the ratings fairly it was necessary to choose between the ""Estimates"" and ""OSCAR"" versions - the OSCAR version seemed closer to the ideal, even though it was not as up to date, and that is assessed here. - https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/oscar-annual-data-october-2014"

Comments by Lorena Rivero - 29/10/2013
My name is Lorena Rivero, in charge of the open budget site in Mexico. Going through the index you recently published, I found some information ranked as ""Unsure"", specifically in the part of Government Spending where it says ""I don't find detailed information about the spending on an eg. monthly basis"".

In this matter I would like to show that we have extensive information in a monthly basis, including income, showing the different taxes and oil income; expenditure in administrative, functional and economic classifications; debt; grants; local government transfers among many other information in http://www.transparenciapresupuestaria.gob.mx/ptp/contenidos/?id=5. All data can be consulted and downloaded (in xls) free of charge according to the terms and conditions stated in the site (Términos y Condiciones de uso de la información) allowing the user to create its own time series and receive the data in different ways, for example in millions, accumulative or percentage of the GDP.

Additional Comments:
Revisions with civil society specialists was done in november 2013. Specialists were not certain that all expenses can be found in a detailed monthly basis."

Lauriault', u'Mor Rubinstein']","This dataset in the US presents some challenges as there is a mixture of data available.

The US Census provide zip-code centroids as part of their 2010 Gazetteer located at http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/gazetteer2010.html in the form of the Zip-Code Tabulation Areas:

http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/docs/gazetteer/Gaz_zcta_national.zip

This data is open data (openly licensed, and machine readable etc).

However, there are some limitations of this data as it is based off the census, the last of which was in 2010. Thus, over time this database gets out of date versus the authoritative  data held by the USPS. Given this, the data is marked as not timely.

In addition, the ZCTA isn’t as complete as the USPS zip-code list as it focused on geographical areas and so its coverage of e.g. PO boxes is more limited. However, given the specifications of this dataset this should not be considered a major limitation and so we have not docked points anywhere else.

### More on Zip-Codes and the USPS

The full database of zip codes from the USPS has not yet been found although it looks like products are available for sale, and they are multiple datasets that can help to provide a whole picture.

The ZCTA file produced by the US Census Bureau is useful but is not the full USPS Database of Zip Codes and lookup tables. Instead, this is a census related product produced every 10 years.

 ""You may have noticed that Census Bureau products refer to “ZIP Code tabulation areas (ZCTAs)” and not simply to ZIP Codes™. The reason that we cannot tabulate data for ZIP Codes is that they do not have distinct geographic boundaries. Designed by the U.S. Postal Service for use in mail delivery, ZIP Codes represent carrier routes made up of individual addresses. A true representation of ZIP Codes would separate out individual housing units and releasing data for them would risk disclosing personally identifiable information"". https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&faqId=10488

The ZCTAs are not the same as the (regularly updated) USPS postal code lookup files or the postal code database with addresses and Lat Long. Those data are for sale and a number of USPS services are resold.

There is an USPS API for companies to integrate their their systems - https://www.usps.com/business/web-tools-apis/address-information-api.htm
Some date exchange for companies - https://www.usps.com/postalone/program.htm
Segmentation direct mail tools https://www.usps.com/business/pdf/Segmentation_WP.pdf
Lots of info about databases and services - https://about.usps.com/publications/pub32/pub32_terms.htm

Regarding information reuse Likumi.lv points to the legislation that determines how this information can be reused and sets the fee for reuse (however, it is not clear what is meant by reuse and if, e.g., publishing law excerpts on a website requires paying the fee or not):

But none of the free offers provides an official extract of the data, and there appear to be some discrepancies in terms of how current the datasets of various providers are."

Whether data is available in bulk is uncertain. This depends on the definition. I've been strict here, since it was not trivial to download the raw base data for all routes in Norway with the current API-documentation. You can however easily list all transport companies, the routes they provide, search to/from and get trip-results, query for further details on each journey etc.

Note1:  the license is not prominently mentioned on the website. It is mentioned on the form you have to fill out to get an API-key.

These data are however generally incomplete, are destroyed every 7 years as per the tax act and are inconsistently managed. They are also not easily available to the public. While these national scale data meet many of the OKFN criteria, the fact that they are incomplete, inaccurate and destroyed every seven years is problematic, especially regarding transparency and investigations into money laundering. Furthermore, they are not readily accessible by the data producer, you can find a company but not a list of all the companies.

Becky Sweger - National priorities project
After a GAO audit (http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-14-476) of USASpending.gov was published this summer, HHS agreed to start submitting aggregated Medicare spending data. I can confirm that Medicare benefits payments are showing up now (they didn't as of a few months ago), but didn't confirm the data are complete.
If Medicare benefits are now represented in USASpending.gov, it's likely no longer true that the site represents ""only a small part of federal spending data."" I'd re-reword to ""So while the data are available, they represent an incomplete picture of federal spending that does not include government salaries, benefits, and other operating expenditures.""
Agency procedures for reporting money paid to (or on behalf of) individuals are inconsistent. The Social Security Administration has always done a great job of reporting. HHS finally decided to aggregate and report Medicare. USDA, however, doesn't accurately report food stamp benefits in USASpending.gov. Since this type of payment represents the largest chunk of U.S. spending, it's important to have consistent and enforced guidelines for reporting.


2013 comments: The data at USASpending.gov accounts for only a fraction of all government spending, and it is organized in a way that makes it hard to understand and use. So while the data are available, it's only a small part of federal spending data. It does not include expenses on government salaries and operating expenditures or information on Medicare, the nation's government sponsored medical insurance for the elderly (~20% of total spending). There are no government-wide spending records that would actually be more helpful --- that is, the government doesn't collect the type of data about its own spending that would be useful to the open government world. 

The data available at USAspending.gov comes from a variety of sources and is presumably licensed based on the original source licenses: http://usaspending.gov/learn?tab=Sources%20of%20Data"

We tried to find this data many times but it's not centralized and most likely unavailable as unified dataset. Russian government delegates ecological issues and pollution monitoring to regional level of the executive government branch. But regional government rarely publish pollution monitoring information and pollution sources. I know only a few public data sources available like Mosecomonitoring (Moscow ecological survey). But even whose data source do not publish source of pollutants, they publish only level of pollutants measured by monitoring stations. Even this information rarely available as datasets, most often this is only ""images"" and ""graphics"". So availability of pollutants data for Russian Federation is about 80% - for ""No"", and only about 20% for ""yes"". The only available sources: - http://dynamic.igce.ru/ (not up to date) - pollution monitoring and radiation monitoring (by Rosatom) - http://www.russianatom.ru/ I suggest this dataset for following review.

Reviewer: the Municipal Councils Elections website (http://www.election.gov.om/) was down at the time of review. It is thus unclear what the availability of elections data is in general as its publication does not seem particularly sustainable with both websites being down (the Shura Council one is down at the time of review as well)."

The data dump is a 1.4 GB zip file, that contains 7 other zip files, yielding over 30GB of data when unpacked, split up in 21MB xml files. This is the full BAG data set, containing all addresses and buildings for all of the Netherlands. From this dataset you need to combine several subsets to get to a full postcode list: The ‘NUM’ files give you address index numbers, its georeferences, the house number and the postcode, and a number that corresponds with a street. The ‘OPR’ files give you the corresponding street name, and the number of the place it is in. The ‘WPL’ files give you the place name, and through a separate table also the municipality it is in. (Do note that is does not include postcodes that are not connected to geolocations, such as PO Boxes) See for a detailed description of the search for the Dutch postcode data; http://www.zylstra.org/blog/2013/10/theoretically-open-post-codes-not-so-much-in-practice/

Reviewers comments: It appears that Botswana does not use company registration numbers, but only register businesses by their name (http://www.gov.bw/en/Business/Sub-audiences/Small--Medium-Businesses/Company--Business-Name-Registration/#a35fb00617eb47dd93b0193e9d5eb0d4 - there is also a search form: http://www.mtinamesearch.gov.bw/search/). However they clearly register companies and must have an internal database or organized register. This register is seemingly not available anywhere online, so I'm amending the submission accordingly and marking this in existence, but not available to the public."
